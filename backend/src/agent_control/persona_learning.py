"""Turn the operator's corrections into durable preferences - with review.

`persona.md` already exists and is re-read on every Operator step, so a line
added here changes behavior immediately and permanently. What was missing is
the loop that gets lines into it: nothing watched for "stop asking me that",
"too long", "always use X", so the file only grew when the model happened to
decide to write to it.

Two deliberate constraints:

**Off by default, behind one switch.** `adapters.persona.learning_enabled`.
Learning from an operator's phrasing is the kind of feature that should be
chosen, not discovered after the fact.

**Proposed, never written.** A suggestion lands in a review queue and only
reaches `persona.md` when a human accepts it. A system that silently edits its
own standing instructions drifts in ways no audit trail can reconstruct - six
months on, "why does it behave like this now?" would have no answer. Every
accepted line therefore carries the date and the message that produced it, so
the file reads as a history rather than as an unexplained ruleset.
