"""Shared test isolation.

The suite must not read the developer's real `.env`. `ybm test` already tries
to arrange that by deleting AGENT_ADMIN_TOKEN from the environment before
invoking pytest, but that is only half the lookup: `read_env_value` is
`os.getenv(key) or read_env_file(env_path).get(key)`, so a token that is
absent from the environment is still found in the *file*.

The effect was 11 admin tests failing with 401 instead of their expected
status on any checkout where `ybm setup` had been run - which is every real
developer machine, since setup generates AGENT_ADMIN_TOKEN. The tests build
their own TestClient instances that deliberately send no admin token, so a
token appearing from the ambient .env turns "assert 404" into "assert 401".

Patching `read_env_file` (rather than ENV_FILE_PATH) is what actually works
here: both `read_env_value` and `ConfigManager` bind ENV_FILE_PATH as a
*default argument*, evaluated once at import, so reassigning the module
constant afterwards changes nothing. `read_env_file` is resolved from module
globals on every call, including from the many modules that imported
`read_env_value` by name.
